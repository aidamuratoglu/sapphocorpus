Artfully adorned Aphrodite, deathless
child of Zeus and weaver of wiles I beg you
please don’t hurt me, don’t overcome my spirit,
goddess, with longing,
but come here, if ever at other moments
hearing these my words from afar you listened
and responded: leaving your father’s house, all
golden, you came then,
hitching up your chariot: lovely sparrows
drew you quickly over the dark earth, whirling
on fine beating wings from the heights of heaven
down through the sky and
instantly arrived—and then O my blessed
goddess with a smile on your deathless face you
asked me what the matter was this time, what I
called you for this time,
what I now most wanted to happen in my
raving heart: “Whom this time should I persuade to
lead you back again to her love? Who now, oh
Sappho, who wrongs you?
If she flees you now, she will soon pursue you;
if she won’t accept what you give, she’ll give it;
if she doesn’t love you, she’ll love you soon now,
even unwilling.”
Come to me again, and release me from this
want past bearing. All that my heart desires to
happen—make it happen. And stand beside me,
goddess, my ally.

Some say thronging cavalry, some say foot soldiers,
others call a fleet the most beautiful of
sights the dark earth offers, but I say it’s whatever you love best.
And it’s easy to make this understood by
everyone, for she who surpassed all human
kind in beauty, Helen, abandoning her
husband—that best of
men—went sailing off to the shores of Troy and
never spent a thought on her child or loving
parents: when the goddess seduced her wits and
left her to wander,
she forgot them all, she could not remember
anything but longing, and lightly straying
aside, lost her way. But that reminds me
now: Anactória,
she’s not here, and I’d rather see her lovely
step, her sparkling glance and her face than gaze on
all the troops in Lydia in their chariots and
glittering armor.

Hektor and his companions escort a dartingeyed
woman from sacred Thebë and fair Plakía’s streams,
delicate Andrómache, aboard their ship
on the salt sea, and with her many golden bracelets
and scented purple robes and intricate adornments,
silver goblets past numbering and ivory.”
So he said. His father leapt up eagerly
and word went to his friends throughout the spacious city.
The sons of Ilus led out mules and harnessed them
to fairwheeled carriages and all the crowd of women
and girls with slender ankles climbed on board [
and Priam’s daughters separately [
And all the young unmarried men led out their stallions

To Andrómeda
When you lie dead there will be no memory of you,
no one missing you afterward, for you have no part
in the roses of Piéria. Unnoticed in the house
of Hades, too, you’ll wander, flittering after faded corpses.


Not one girl, I think, will ever look on the sunlight
of another time who has such talent as this one does.

To Andrómeda
That country girl has witched your wishes,
all dressed up in her country clothes
and she hasn’t got the sense
to hitch her rags above her ankles.

The violet-lapped Muses’ lovely gifts belong
to you now, children, and the piercing lyre, the friend of song.
My body that, before, was supple, age already
has taken by surprise, my raven tresses are turned white,
my spirit has grown heavy and my knees too weak
to carry me, that once were quick to dance as fawns.
I grumble at them often but what good is that?
For human beings to be ageless is not possible.
They say that once, for love, Dawn of the rosy arms
carried Tithonos aboard her golden bowl to the world’s end
when young and handsome, but all the same in time gray age
caught up with him, although his wife was an immortal goddess.

She was leaving me, saying goodbye, her cheeks
wet with tears, and she said to me:
“What a cruel unhappiness,
Sappho, I swear that I leave you against my will.”
This is what I replied to her:
“Go, fare well, and remember me,
for you certainly know how we cared for you.
If you don’t, why then, I would like
to remind you [
] and the beautiful times we had:
for with many a crown of roses
mixed with crocus and violets
you were garlanded while you were at my side
and with many a flower necklace
you encircled your tender throat,
plaiting blossoms together to make a wreath,
and with flowery perfumes [
precious, queenly [
you anointed yourself [

Now the dew filters down in its beauty, now
roses bloom and the tender chervil

Often, when she goes wandering she remembers
her kind Attis, and now perhaps
her subtle heart is consumed with potent yearning.
Always her thoughts turn, longing to come where we
